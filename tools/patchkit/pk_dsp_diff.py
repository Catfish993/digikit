"""The DSP difference of two .syx images as a DSP patch file (packages/emulator/boot/src/dsp_patch.rs).

    uv run python -m tools.patchkit.pk_dsp_diff BASE.syx PATCHED.syx OUT.patch

Every run of bytes that the boot stream (section 7) of PATCHED loads differently from BASE becomes one `BYTES <loader address> <hex>` line (code is at its
`0x28000000 + 2 pc` alias, appended code and tables at their L2 address). `coupled-run --dsp-patch OUT.patch` applies it to the imported DSP state, so a
headless run can time a patched image without the control daemon (tools/devtools/coupled_ab.py `--patch`). Firmware-derived: write OUT outside the repository.
