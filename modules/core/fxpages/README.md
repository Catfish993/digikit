# Effect pages (core/fxpages)

Gives each run-time effect row of `core/dynfx` its own page in the FX view of the Digitakt II and the Digitone II, after CHO: DEL, REV, CHO, then the pages of the loaded effects in effect-row
order. It reserves the parameter rows of the pages (24: 7 knobs and MIX for each of the 3 effect slots) and four small hooks (the page accessor, the FX view's page list,
the tab label and the filter graph). It also keeps the effects' knob values with the kit (three hooks on the firmware's kit loader, saver and initialiser of the effect value array: finding 61 "Persistence"). It changes nothing by itself: with no effect loaded the FX view is the stock one and a kit's bytes are as stock writes them (the spare halfwords it uses are zero). The digikit runtime fills the rows from the
`[[fx]]` page of a `.dkm` (`docs/design/digikit-registry.md`, "Effect pages"; finding 61). Needs `core/runtime`, `core/params`, `core/dynreg` and `core/dynfx`.
Device facts (page numbers, kit value indices, template rows) are in the device file's `[fx]` section. Digitakt II 1.16 and 1.17 and Digitone II 1.12. Both devices have it in the `emulator` and the `device` patch set (on the Digitone II the hook of `core/fx` costs the emulator x1.01 DSP CPU since the engine bars only the changed blocks, finding 55).

## The send page (FX routing, finding 64; Digitakt II 1.17)

An effect can run on a send bus instead of the master (`core/fx`, finding 62). The amounts of such an effect are set like the stock sends: the track FX key (page 12: BR, OVER, SRR, SR.RT, DEL, REV, CHR, OD.RT) gets a second page with one knob for each send effect,
for the current track. Three more hooks and a page row do it: `fxp_acc` also answers the page number `page_first + fx_slots` (the send row: the title and the level slot of page 12, the knob cells are the runtime's), `fxp_keylist` gives the track FX key the list
{12, send page} while `fxp_send_count` is 2 (the runtime sets it before the view is built, so a route change shows after a restart), and `fxp_sound` counts the sound loads (the firmware's sound loader zeroes the Sound array indices of the knobs; the runtime writes the
stored amounts back when the count changes). Two parameter rows (`params.fs0`, `fs1`) are the knobs: Sound array indices `[fx] send_indices` (69 and 70), the value class of the kit's Delay rows (no p-lock), the owner of the stock send row, no CC. The amounts live in
the settings store, never in an Elektron file; the runtime (`fxsend.rs`) reads the Sound arrays and updates the settings and the DSP row. With no send effect the FX key is the stock one pixel for pixel. The author of an effect never sees the amounts: the framework
owns route and amounts (`docs/design/digikit-dkm.md`). The Digitone II has it too (finding 67: page 16 is its track FX page, the send page is number 40, Sound index 100, one send cell: `SEND_SLOTS` 1; `fxpages_info` version 2 on both devices).
