| dk_make_sp(out, parent, view): the firmware's shared_ptr<View> constructor takes `out` in a0 and (parent, view) on the
|   stack; this adapts the cdecl call from C. It makes the control block (use count 1) and registers a detach callback on the
|   view that clears the shared_ptr at parent+0x90. Core/ui passes a parent that is a zeroed heap block, so that clear changes
|   nothing, and keeps the returned shared_ptr for the session: the firmware then never frees the view.

| dk_hook: the hook at the end of the SETTINGS rebuild (cf.menu.hook.settings_list.tail), entered by `jmp`. Live registers: a2 = the
|   settings menu (`this`), d4 = the saved selection, sp = the rebuild's frame; d0/d1/a0/a1 are dead. It calls the optional
|   dk_app_settings_rows(settings_menu) of the app (an optional link: 0 when no app is in the image) and returns to the rebuild
|   through the hook tail, where the displaced instructions run.
