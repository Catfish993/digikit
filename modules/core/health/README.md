# core/health

Measures what the DIGIKIT HEALTH page shows: CPU load, the DSP's block time and the firmware heap. Emulator only: nothing here has run
on a device.

- **CPU.** The boot thread ends in an empty loop once every task exists (finding 36), so it runs only when no task is ready. A hook
  replaces the thread's last call, makes it and counts in that loop. The DSP block interrupt (1500 per second) closes a one-second
  window and keeps the iterations; load = 100 - 100 * window / best window since boot.
- **DSP.** The DSP's block handler reads EMUCLK at its start and end and puts the difference in the first word of its reply; a hook at
  the entry of the block interrupt handler reads that word once per block (window average and maximum). No DSP code is patched.
- **RAM.** The heap's free lists are walked on request, under the allocator's mutex, at most 4096 nodes.

The runtime's `dkrt_health` (C ABI) combines these with its own arena and DSP area; the DIGIKIT menu shows them. Results and costs:
