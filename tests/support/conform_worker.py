"""Runs the conformance cases of one machine module on one device and prints the result as JSON.

    PYTHONPATH=<repo>:<repo>/tests python -m support.conform_worker MODULE DEVICE [--group G ...] [--seed N]

tests/modules/test_machine_conformance.py starts one worker per (module, device), under PyPy when uv can run it (the concrete
core is plain Python: PyPy is 3 to 4 times faster, which keeps a machine under a minute) and under the test's own Python
otherwise. The cases come from tools/patchkit/pk_conform.py; this file runs them on tests/support/machine_rig.py and checks
the invariants of every block:

  returned   the call came back to the caller within the rig's step limit
  context    the context registers (M5 ... MODE1) are as they went in
  finite     every output sample is finite (the output block is NaN before the call: a sample the routine did not write fails)
  bound      |sample| <= LEVEL_BOUND
  guard      the runtime guard of core/dsp-voice did not step in (DT2: its fault count stays 0; a guarded block is zeroed, so
             finite and bound alone would pass a broken routine)
  writes     the module's code stored only to the output block, its own voice state, its own data and its stack
             (tests/support/machine_rig.py `_allowed`); the "writes" group also runs two voices at once
  budget     instructions of the block <= the voice-block budget; the block of a trigger (DN2: and the one after the edge)
             <= the note-on budget (pk_conform.budget)

A case stops at its first failure; the message names module, device, case, block, parameter words, note, velocity and the
first bad sample, so the failure can be reproduced from it alone."""
