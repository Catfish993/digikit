"""`firmware.load {runtime: true}` against a real coupled daemon: the controller patches the stock image with the device's patch
set, boots it, and the digikit runtime answers an INFO request over `midi.usb.*`. A patched input is loaded as it is.

Slow (a coupled cold boot per device, cached under out/runs/patchkit/run-runtime-load-<device>). Skips without the stock
firmware, its ready inputs (`tools/emulator/ready.py`, paths in tools/patchkit/pk_harness.py `FIRMWARE`) or a buildable
digi-emud (DIGI_EMUD names one outright). The runs are bounded: INFO steps at most 2 billion instructions.
