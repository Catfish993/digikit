# 47. Digitakt II on the device: the flash rungs

Em's Digitakt II, OS 1.17, 2026-10-18. Images and steps: docs/PATCHING.md "Flashing a Digitakt II, rung by rung"; plan
`docs/plans/digikit-runtime.md` Phase 9. Marks: **[D]** measured once on the device, **[O]** open. The log lines are what
`tools/device/dklog.py follow --once` printed over USB (the runtime's LOG command, finding 46).

## Rung A: the runtime with no DSP change **[D]**

Image `out/patch/rungA-dt2-1.17.syx` (`core/runtime,core/digikit-menu,core/health`; sha256 `01e8cae4a713f5a7...`; preflight: section 3
only, sections 2, 4, 5, 7 and 8 identical to stock), flashed through SETTINGS > SYSTEM > OS UPGRADE with Transfer.

- It boots to the main screen; SETTINGS lists DIGIKIT; the log arrives over USB SysEx.
- `BOOT_START runtime=3 device=1`, `UI_FIRST blocks=4481` (2.99 s of firmware blocks after the hook; the coupled emulator: 5,972 on a
  blank card, finding 37), `STABLE blocks=49485` (the 30 s period ran out), no safe mode, nothing loaded, `DSP_ABSENT` (no `dl_diag`
  on this rung, as designed).
- **The module store range on this card is blank:** `CARD_CHECK state=blank first_nonblank=None read_errors=0` (all of sectors
  0x38000-0x3E000 read through the firmware's block read; finding 46). The runtime wrote nothing to the card (a blank card gets the
  record only when the selection changes).
- `RAM_KEEP kept=0 generation=0`: the first boot after a flash has no marker. Whether RAM survives a soft reset on this board is still
  **[O]** (the menu offers APPLY & RESTART only with a store; rung C).
- HEALTH, steady over 70 s with the device idle at the main screen: CPU 27.3-28.1 % (relative to the boot's idle floor, finding 41;
  the emulator reads 20-34 %), DSP 40.8 % average, 44.2 % maximum (EMUCLK block time at the assumed 1 GHz), heap free 27,448 KiB
  (emulator 26.7 MB). The DSP figure is about 1.3 times the emulator's 31 % on an idle sample card, inside the DT2 cycle factors of
  `devices/cycle-factors.json` (1.13 nominal, 1.41 high); with the same project on both sides it would calibrate the factor, or show the
  clock is not 1 GHz **[O]**.

## Rung B: with the DSP link and the voice hook, no modules **[D]**

Image `out/patch/rungB-dt2-1.17.syx` (rung A plus `core/dynreg,core/dyndsp`, which add `core/machines`, `core/params`, `core/dsp-link`,
`core/dsp-voice`; sha256 `7d2851ee8f7460eb...`; preflight: sections 3 and 7). Em played a project with sample tracks for about a minute and
previewed a sample; `dklog follow` ran for 172 s.

- The DSP ran the whole session: no `DSP_STOPPED`; both heartbeats of `dl_diag` (finding 45) rose by exactly 1500 per second (the link
  hook's word 1 and the voice hook's word 2: the hook ran every block on stock voices).
- **The context registers at the voice hook on silicon equal the emulator's, all eleven**, constant over the session:
  M5 0, M6 1, M7 -1, M13 0, M14 1, M15 -1, I6 `0x2cb2c8`, I7 `0x2cb2c0`, B7 `0x2ca5a0`, L7 `0x3e2`, MODE1 `0x39011cf8`
  (`uv run python -m tools.patchkit.pk_ctxprobe --device dt2 --fw 1.17 --modules core/dsp-voice,core/dsp-link` gives the same words). So the
  2026-10 hardware report's two causes (M6 and M13 not having these values) did not hold at this hook on this device, which agrees with
  finding 45; what halted the SHARC there is still **[O]**.
- `RAM_KEEP kept=1 generation=1`: the keep marker that rung A's boot wrote survived the reboot that ends the OS update, so RAM above
  `cf.expansion` (`[digikit] keep_base`) is kept across that reset on this board. That the same holds for the runtime's own soft reset is
  likely but not yet seen.
- HEALTH: idle CPU about 30 %, DSP 41.5 % average idle (rung A: 40.8 %; the hook and link cost about 0.7 points), 55 % average and 59.6 %
  maximum while the pattern played; CPU 95-100 % for about 20 s while the project loaded. Heap free 27,416-27,449 KiB.
- The card check again reported the store range blank; nothing was written.

## Rung C: pluck loaded at run time, the SHARC halts **[D]**

Image `out/patch/rungC-dt2-1.17.syx` (sha256 `fb6caf04...`, with the breadcrumbs of finding 48), module `out/patch/dyn-pluck-dt2.dkm`
(sha256 `e66c4660...`). Logs `out/runs/device-logs/rungC-{1,2,3}.log` (not committed).

- **Upload over our SysEx works on the device:** `dkupload put` wrote the 4,484-byte module into the blank store range with the sha256
  checked on the device; `ls` lists it. The first card write by our code on this card.
- **The menu and boot load work:** MODULES tick, APPLY & RESTART; the next boot read `CARD_CHECK state=ours`, `BOOT_RECORD seq=1
  selected=1`, `MOD_LOAD result=1` and 0.1 s after the first UI pass `MOD_DSP result=0` (the DSP part transferred and acknowledged);
  ABOUT `BOOT: 1 OF 1 OK`.
- **RAM survives the runtime's own soft reset:** `RAM_KEEP kept=1 generation=3` after APPLY & RESTART (generation 2 was the update reboot).
- **Then the SHARC halted, without our routine ever being called.** Em selected PLUCK on track 1 and held TRIG 1: no sound. Both
  heartbeats froze at about 151.4 s of the session (link beat 221,802 at 143.4 s, then 233,838 and no further: 8.02 s later), and the
  watch logged `DSP_STOPPED` 4 s after. At the halt: `crumb=HOOK_ENTERED voice=31 type=0`, **`dispatches=0 returns=0` for the whole
  session**, the eleven context registers unchanged. So `core/dsp-voice` never saw type 18 on any voice and never called the pluck
  routine; its last breadcrumb is the one every normal block ends with (voice 31). The halt is outside the wrapper's machine path.
- **A halted core's reply records keep arriving** (valid header, frozen beats), so the breadcrumbs are readable after a halt on silicon:
  the DMA keeps sending (finding 48's open question, answered). The two records differ by one block (233,838 and 233,839); the watch
  read the larger one as a beat and logged a false `resumed=True` at 171 s, then stopped again (a watch bug: compare the larger of the two
  records). **[C]** Fixed in `dlog.rs`: after a stop the samples keep the larger heartbeat of the two records as the reference, and only a heartbeat
  16 blocks past it counts as running again (`RESUME_MARGIN`; a running DSP adds 1500 a second). **[D]** `debug-hang` checks that no `resumed=True` follows a stop
  (the emulator's two records differ too, 2 sets); the device case itself is not re-run.
- The ColdFire stayed healthy (UI, USB, log, HEALTH) after the halt, as in the 2026-10 hardware report.
- Reading **[O]**: the same flow passes in the emulator (scenario `rung-c`, where the hook dispatches type 18 thousands of times). On the
  device the type never reached the hook, which points at stock DSP code that routes or indexes by machine type before the voice hook,
  reading something the emulator has differently (for example a per-type table sized for the 7 stock types, read out of range, where the
  emulator's memory is zero and the device's is not). Not yet checked.
- **After the halt (Em, 2026-10-18, no log kept):** a power cycle with the module still selected and loaded, and the saved project still
  holding type 18 on track 1: Em set track 1 back to ONESHOT, then selecting a sample froze the whole device (the halted-SHARC sign of the
  2026-10 hardware report), so the DSP was most likely dead again before any note. After another power cycle, with track 1 on a stock
  machine and the module still loaded, SLICE and ONESHOT played and auditioned normally. So a track holding the added type is enough; a
  note and the routine are not needed. Whether the first halt came at the selection or at TRIG 1 is not known **[O]**.
- **Page 2 of PLUCK** drew almost blank on the device (the TUNE glyph and the bar indicators); encoders there show page 1's names. Cause
  and fix: finding 50 (a CF view chooses the page's centre widget by type with a mask for types 0-6; reproduced in the emulator).
